### Hello 👋,  I'm Juliano (He/Him) and since 1989 I've been around.

⚡ Fun fact: I'd say that the first years of my life I didn't achieve so much, but there was a story about myself eating a bug that my mother used to love sharing with everyone 😄.

When I was 7 I felt in love with basketball 🏀 in a country that almost every single person loves football ⚽, yes, I'm from Brazil 🇧🇷.
I've dedicated myself to the sport till 17 and I couldn't see another outcome but starting a Physical Education course, once becoming a professional player wasn't one of my options.

During my graduation I've realized that Physical Education is a lot more than just basketball, and even though I knew that I wouldn't like to work with it, I've decided to get the course done considering that I was in a good University and knowledge is never too much 🤓.

After completing the course I've started a technical IT course focused in software development, and that was the third time that I felt in love in my whole life.
Yes, third, because between basketball and IT I met my beloved wife 😍.

In my first Logic Programming class I could see myself doing that for the rest of my life. During my last semester in the course, I've got my first job in IT in a multinational company, where I could work for 3 years with technologies such as Java, Spring, PL/SQL, Shell Script and Git.

🛫 Later on I've decided to challenge myself and get out of my comfort zone trying an international career.

🔭 I’m currently living in Linz, Austria, working as a Software Engineer and using technologies such as Kubernetes , Docker, Git, Java, Shell Script and OpenTelemetry, just to quote some.

That's basically how my journey has started...
