# Hello there 👋🏽

I'm Juliano (He/Him) around since 1989.

🐛 Fun fact: My mother loved sharing this story—when I was a baby crawling around the
house, she once heard a “crack” sound. She rushed over, checked my mouth, and found I
was munching on a centipede! Safe to say, I’ve been catching bugs since early in life. 😄

Originally from Brazil 🇧🇷, I now live in Austria 🇦🇹 with my wife and child.

As a ☁️ CNCF Ambassador, I help organize the Cloud Native Linz meetup. If you're in the
region, feel free to join us on our [Meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/Cloud-Native-Linz)
or [Community CNCF page](https://community.cncf.io/linz/). We host monthly events focused
on Cloud Native topics.

I also had the pleasure of being part of the team organizing
[KCD Austria 2024](https://kcdaustria.at/).

Currently, I work as a Developer Advocate at [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/),
focusing on OpenTelemetry.

I'm a maintainer of the [OpenTelemetry Demo](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-demo),
a microservice-based distributed system that demonstrates OpenTelemetry implementation
in a near-real-world environment.
